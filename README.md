# Mapping UK Civil Servants
This repo is an R project that uses the [NOMIS API](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/) and [`leaflet`](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) R package to produce maps of UK civil servants.

Note this requires a development version of [crosstalk](https://github.com/rstudio/crosstalk/tree/joe/feature/filter-select-default) that implements default selection, install via `{remotes}`.

```r
remotes::install_github("rstudio/crosstalk", ref = "joe/feature/filter-select-default")
```
